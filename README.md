Spend less time deciding on what to watch, and more time enjoying cinema!

Abyss was made to help sort through the endless movie titles available to us through our various streaming services. Instead of jumping from service to service to see what is currently streaming, you can browse all movies available to be played at any given moment using Abyss.

Add the services you are subscribed to and see a master list in one place. Sort by genre, rating, year etc. Save your favorites.

 Link accounts with friends and family to start making list of movies you both want to watch. Get some popcorn! Enjoy :)
